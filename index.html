			 <p>The last three things on my mind from this week of building <a href="https://github.com/mrled/ldapenforcer">LDAPEnforcer</a> from scratch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Claude Code only has the bluntest access to tools like the type system. When you ask it to make a conceptually simple change that I might start by deleting a variable definition and then looking for red underlines in my editor, it just finds one part of the code at random and changes it, and looks for references elsewhere. If it had a direct interface to type systems, linters, etc, that&rsquo;d make it a lot faster.</li>
<li>Watching it do dumbshit things like make up arguments to <code>cat</code> or read file contents with <code>xxd</code> was cute at first and then very annoying (especially if you&rsquo;re paying attention to <code>/cost</code>&hellip;).</li>
<li>It <em>desperately</em> needs an always-safe set of tools it can run. If I&rsquo;ve already given you access to the codebase, you shouldn&rsquo;t ask for permission to run grep, but as I mentioned previously you really should know that piping grep&rsquo;s output to something else has implications beyond grep). But beyond that, is having the LLM directly call shell commands really the best way to do this?</li>

			 <p>Continuing from <a href="https://whispers.micahrl.com/2025/03/23/some-unfiltered-thoughts-on-claude/">last time</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was very exciting to work with this yesterday. Then I kept waking up last night worrying about job security. The times, they are uncertain.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://whispers.micahrl.com/2025/01/04/ai-chatbot-feature-request-a/">manifested</a> the Claude Code automatic context management functionality</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still waiting for my <a href="https://whispers.micahrl.com/2025/01/18/i-wish-i-could-give/">manifestation</a> of it using PRs automatically. Supposedly it&rsquo;ll retrieve the contents of a URL you give it and take instructions from there (fortunately I can see no security issues with this); if you take this idea just a little further you might think that running the god damned thing in my terminal makes no sense at all, and you should interact with it in a web page, and it should submit all its changes as PRs</li>
<li>Which would allow you to have multiple of these things working on the same codebase at once! As you accept PRs, they each rebuild their own branches, and handle merge conflicts.</li>
<li>I think both of these things are in the works from <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer">people familiar with the product space</a>; I&rsquo;m not having novel ideas, but using the product for a few minutes really makes you want this stuff.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t have as good an eye for making reviewable changes as you&rsquo;d like. Sometimes all the tests change and it&rsquo;s hard to understand why. For a side project, you probably just YOLO accept; for code that&rsquo;ll run in production, this will get really boring.</li>
<li>It really wants to maintain backwards compatibility, which would be nice sometimes, but I really don&rsquo;t need that for a feature you just wrote 5 minutes ago</li>
<li>Because there is so much time that Claude is churning away spending your money on tokens, this feels a lot less like programming flow state; it&rsquo;s very easy to get distracted and half do 5 things as you keep an eye on Claude in case it got stuck or is asking you for help. In this way it is less enjoyable.</li>
<li>&hellip; I appreciate that you&rsquo;re asking for permission before running shell commands, but <code>cd ... &amp;&amp; ...</code> is not a &ldquo;cd command&rdquo;.
<ul>
<li><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/103095/2025/screenshot-2025-03-24-at-14.43.51.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Really does not have a good idea of when to comment; if you provide no guidance it&rsquo;ll shit out a whole file with no comments; if you tell it to comment everything it&rsquo;ll provide inane comments like <code>mainLogLevel := logging.InfoLevel // Default to INFO level</code> (that&rsquo;s a real example).</li>
<li>Imagining a future version of this stuff
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have the LLM comment <em>any</em> code</li>
<li>Strictly track what was LLM generated, and associate it with the prompt (could be a prompt from another LLM)</li>
<li>Strictly track human edits and associate with some comments or commit messages</li>
<li>Could use git for this, but Claude Code&rsquo;s attempt at an implementation that does so is too ham-fisted for actual use, so I end up artisinally crafting all the commit messages</li>
<li>Have another LLM help you explain the code, including generating comments at viewing time. Explanations tailored to the user, and the context. The tool knows when you&rsquo;re stepping into a codebase for the first time and when you&rsquo;ve just viewed all the other relevant modules and provides &ldquo;comments&rdquo; that are appropriate to each case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The real power is having it write tests and test the code it writes. However, it is still pretty LLM-stupid, so you end up with Intro to Programming -level tests like <code>TestInitializeDefaultLogLevelIsInfo</code>.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Everyone is right, <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a> is fucking mindblowing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dang it can build the code, run it, see an error, and modify the code all itself without returning to me</p>
<p>omg</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Why do AI companies hate the productization part? It&rsquo;s so bizarre that on the first launch they give you an option of 6 different color schemes, but windows support is a coming-maybe feature</li>
<li>The idea of using this on an untrusted codebase is &hellip; yikes. I see they warn you not to. But once you try it, the temptation will be strong. And when you have a project with open contribution (on GitHub, accepts PRs, etc), that&rsquo;s like, a gaping hole.</li>
<li>If you have a project you&rsquo;ve wanted to start but don&rsquo;t have time, set it up and start from zero.</li>
<li>OK more on productization and security: I appreciate that it asks me before running bash commands, but it would be nice if they would whitelist commands like touch and mkdir. Also it keeps asking me to cat files in the repo which it already has access to, come on bro</li>
<li>Really wish it kept a transcript of my interactions that was saved to the repo. Or saved the prompts to the commits. Or something.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>uhhhhhhhhhhhh. this thing is amazing.</p>
<p>It wrote an ldap client for me</p>
<p>and created users and groups in my actual ldap server</p>
<p>this is unbelievable</p>
<p>It took me longer to set up a test LDAP server than it did to have it write code to connect and sync users and groups</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>2700 lines of code in less than 4 hours, with tests. It actually works on my real LDAP server.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if this + voice recog LLMs means I can code on a laptop without using an ergo keyboard or having my hands hurt</li>
<li>As my codebase gets bigger this thing is really lighting money on fire. Edits taking 5+ minutes regularly</li>
<li>Honestly this thing really needs to be able to work in its own branch. While I&rsquo;m sitting here waiting up to 10 minutes in the case of one edit, I would really like to be looking at the codebase and working on something else.</li>
<li>All told today it wrote 3800 lines of Go in about 5 hours of working with it and $25 of tokens</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="product-idea-1-patch-maintainer">Product idea 1: patch maintainer</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking how much more software this will put out into the world. And how much more work it&rsquo;ll seem like to make an open source project that is all things to all users.</p>
<p>Example: my app manages LDAP users/groups. Config file with users and groups, and some dedicated OUs (think like folders where your users/groups are in the LDAP directory), and it makes the LDAP users/groups look exactly like the config file. Idea is you can keep your users/groups/memberships in git, so your LDAP server has no state. (We made something like this at a previous job as a way to keep people from having access they shouldn&rsquo;t; we could use git history to tell auditors exactly who had access to what when.)</p>
<p>But right now it&rsquo;s tied to <strong>my</strong> LDAP server. LDAP is very configurable, you can keep your users in the &ldquo;people&rdquo; OU, or the &ldquo;users&rdquo; OU, or the &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; OU, or anything you want. They might be of type <code>inetOrgPerson</code>, or <code>organizationalPerson</code>, or just <code>account</code>, or (as Active Directory does) <code>sAMAccountName</code>, etc. LDAP is a &ldquo;directory&rdquo;, and using it as a specific user/group database is not standardized.</p>
<p>So for my tool to be useful to the world at large, I would have to make it as configurable as LDAP is. A ton of setup gunk. One way that could go in the new world of Claude Code et al is, I&rsquo;ll just write this one for me, and you write one for you, and it&rsquo;s honestly fine because I did this for my fucking homelab on a weekend day between hanging with family and stuff.</p>
<p>But another option is, I could release this open source, and you could have a build pipeline that has Claude Code in there where you tell it &ldquo;take this code and change it so that it works with my LDAP structure&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="product-idea-2-infrastructure-as-code-platform-with-locally-runnable-test">Product idea 2: Infrastructure as Code platform with locally runnable test</h2>
<p>Talking to even expensive APIs like OpenAI o1 about Kubernetes is a mess. Claude Code can write the code, test it, read the errors, and modify it in a loop. I saw it do this multiple times. What if an IaC platform enabled this without deploying first?</p>
<p>This would help humans a lot too!</p>
<p>It would also improve editor support - right now VS Code can F2 -&gt; rename a symbol across multiple files, but Ansible and Kubernetes are just string matching, so if you misspell anything anywhere it just fails. I&rsquo;m imagining something with a whole syntax and type system like a language.</p>
<p>Or maybe the right solution is just a library on some existing language. Use something with an extensible type system.</p>
<p>Maybe Pulumi could turn into this.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s missing is a high level of integration so that testing locally works exactly like deploying to productionn</p>
<h2 id="my-project">My project</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://github.com/mrled/ldapenforcer">ldapenforcer</a></li>
<li>I want an idempotent LDAP user/group/membership tool, so I can define them in config files and keep them in Git</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been putting it off because it would be a lot of work, probably a week or two of banging my head against the wall on nights and weekends</li>
<li>Claude Code just&hellip; did it. From a note of ideas to working MVP in one day. I can&rsquo;t believe it.</li>

<p>I kind of can&rsquo;t believe I just plugged it all together. Getting the compiled languages to talk to each other was a little difficult, and going from zero to one in Cordova took a little while, but really the whole thing&hellip; works.

<blockquote>
<p>I implemented static HTML comments on my website by tail&rsquo;ing the /var/logs/nginx/access.log with a perl script. No CGI, no database, just the actual text of the comments stored as a single comment per line in a .html file.</p>
<p>To comment a visitor takes any url on the domain and appends &ldquo;/@say/&rdquo;. Like <a href="http://notmyurl.com/somepage.html/@say/Some">notmyurl.com/somepage&hellip;.</a> response to somepage. Or &ldquo;&hellip;lakephoto.jpg/@say/Cool fish! How long was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The perl script sees the /@say/ in the logs and adds the parsed out and sanitized comment to an .html file. There&rsquo;s some nginx location hijinks for matching /@say/ URLs that goes to a confirmation page and redirects to the comment listing page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this comment system on my tor onion services sites for the last decade. I get plenty of people trying to exploit it. It&rsquo;s kind of fun. If the Tor folk haven&rsquo;t pwned it I doubt the HN folk will. Not for lack of skill but mostly a lack of motivation relative to the tor folk.</p>

			 <p>In April, the White House released <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Celestial-Time-Standardization-Policy.pdf">a memo on a standard for lunar time (PDF)</a>. I hope it is not too late to save the country from a terrible mistake: abbreviating this standard as &ldquo;LTC&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;LTC&rdquo; is a jumbled initialism for Coordinated Lunar Time, patterned after &ldquo;UTC&rdquo; as a jumbled initialism for Coordinated Universal Time. But why jumble the initialisms? <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">The UTC Wikipedia page</a> quotes a paper which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1967 the CCIR adopted the names Coordinated Universal Time and Temps Universel Coordonné for the English and French names with the acronym UTC to be used in both languages. The name &ldquo;Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)&rdquo; was approved by a resolution of IAU Commissions 4 and 31 at the 13th General Assembly in 1967 (Trans. IAU, 1968).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that Earth&rsquo;s coordinated time is abbreviated in a cut-the-baby compromise with the <em>French</em>, but at least the French are actually on Earth. Lunar time should be decided in a symposium on the moon itself. If you want your voice heard, you should have to land there.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps a weird way to put it, but it&rsquo;s accurate to say that I&rsquo;ve been <em>enjoying</em> tracking my food intake for the past 6 months. I&rsquo;ve been tracking exercise for longer, and I started tracking food too when I realized I was mentally reaching for my phone after meals to record the data - I wanted to have a record of how I was doing.</p>
<p>I use MacroFactor, which is thoughtfully designed to do the job and get out of your way. I expected tracking to feel bad, but that mostly hasn&rsquo;t happened. I set an agreement with myself that I can eat and drink whatever I want as long as I track it accurately, which has been freeing, but also has highlighted food that I wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed enough to be worth its calories.</p>
<p>It has helped to track some positive things too: I&rsquo;m trying to get a good macro balance of protein/carbs/fat, and in particular eat more protein than I would naturally; I&rsquo;m not just trying to avoid junk food.</p>
<p>Some things I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tend to eat more fat than my targets but often fewer carbs; I expected the reverse</li>
<li>Alcohol is even higher calorie than I realized, but more insidiously, I am much hungrier on days I drink than days I don&rsquo;t (I still enjoy a drink most days)</li>
<li>100cal of protein feels much more satisfying than 100cal of either carbs or fat when I&rsquo;m hungry between meals</li>

			 <p>An off the cuff idea:</p>
<p>AI training on public data is driving privatization of user-generated content (eg Reddit API). This could push users with a real need for the information who today rely on public google search to build private archives. For instance, keeping a copy of the most insightful StackExchange answers that help you do your job.</p>
<p>If that happens, AI companies that figure out how to ingest private archives will have a training advantage, even if doing so is a gray area legally, as training based on sci-hub was for modern models.</p>
<p>It might even mean that the quality of the training goes <em>up</em> even as the amount of publicly available UGC goes down, since the private archives are curated by humans, and curation is a quality signal.</p>

			 <p>Michał Sapka notes that <a href="https://michal.sapka.me/2023/reddit-and-the-centralized-web/">PhpBB is a good way to create a small community</a>. I&rsquo;d like this to be true, but I think this makes the barrier to entry too high for normie participation.</p>
<p>I think part of the reason Reddit has been so successful is that website account creation is such a chore. If every subreddit required a separate account, would they have a tenth of their users? A hundredth? Less?</p>
<p>Currently if you&rsquo;re a small blog or community and want to provide persistent identity for commenting/forums, you need to allow some subset of account creation with email and integration with identity providers like Apple, Google, Github, etc. But you can&rsquo;t reasonably offer <em>all</em> of them, because there are too many! It&rsquo;s a front end design problem: do you want commenting on your blog to require searching through the list of all possible identity providers? Sounds very 2007.</p>
<p>And email as the identity manager is just awful: not only do you have to share a password or use a password manager, but you have wait for the site to send you an email and click a link before your account can be set up.</p>
<p>What if the browser stored a user&rsquo;s preference for identity provider? Support everyone, let the browser prompt the user to log in with the one they already selected. No overdramatic interstitial &ldquo;WARNING: THIS WILL ALLOW THE WEBSITE example.com READ ONLY ACCESS TO YOUR: PUBLIC PROFILE&rdquo; (the user already accepted it), no email link.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also unphishable, as it happens in browser chrome.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hypothesis: LLMs will enable developers like me to build apps that require a serviceable but not world class graphical UI. This could unlock a deluge of applications built from or inspired by existing open-source command-line apps that don&rsquo;t have a GUI complement, especially mobile apps.</p>
<p>One reason I&rsquo;ve always liked the command line is that it&rsquo;s easy to build a decent UI - even a good one. I&rsquo;ve churned out a few dozen lines of python to create a great little CLI many times over the years, and it only takes a few minutes now. But GUIs are such a deep subject that require their own expertise, and all the GUIs I&rsquo;ve built have taken weeks.</p>
<p>I started a SwiftUI app in Xcode yesterday and found myself missing Copilot immediately. I haven&rsquo;t used Swift in a long time, and I&rsquo;ve never used SwiftUI, so the median Copilot suggestion would have been extremely welcome. But what I realized I <em>really</em> wanted to ask a hypothetical XCode Copilot is &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the normal way to build an app that has one main screen and some sub-views in SwiftUI?&rdquo;. I had no idea how to do this, and I wasn&rsquo;t contexted enough in SwiftUI to ask the right questions.</p>
<p>In my experience with actual Github Copilot, and also with ChatGPT, questions about the normal way to do something get the best results. I&rsquo;ve never seen a useful answer inventing new techniques, but they can certainly give you the average quicksort implementation (and explain it too). If they can do that for building simple GUIs, that will let a lot of command-line programmers like me graduate to baby&rsquo;s first mobile app.</p>
<p>All of this would be really great even for users, because it might be the rising tide that takes open source software GUIs from subpar to good enough. I am guessing that there are thousands of useful apps that have very simple UIs with just a few screens, and that maybe there are thousands more that complement existing open source command-line programs which could be built if making the GUI was easier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the LLMs are there today; I haven&rsquo;t built any graphical UIs with Copilot. I wonder what the state of this is at Google with Android Studio, or at Microsoft with whatever its mobile app GUI system is, or at Microsoft with Visual Studio (the big one, not VS Code). It seems like it&rsquo;s too early to be optimized in any direction yet, but maybe they have this already. Would be neat to try it out.</p>

			 <p>A recent <a href="https://tweets.micahrl.com/twarchive/1595281933696749569/">shower thought</a>: consumer routers could enforce good IoT manufacturer behavior by placing devices on a secure, contained network by default, and allowing full access only if a device is receiving security updates.</p>
<p>The default network would be slower and heavily limited in endpoints it could hit, and in particular would not allow accessing any other devices on the local network. If an IoT manufacturer commits to security updates, they could be allowed on the full network. Defection could be subject to legal liabilities, up to a lawsuit in the worst case.</p>
<p>Over time, the feature could become more sophisticated, for instance by providing a better EOL experience. Currently, IoT manufacturers just leave their waste with the customer and mostly don&rsquo;t even tell them (a <a href="https://schwarztech.net/snippets/researchers-find-security-flaw-in-wemo-smart-plug-belkin-says-it-wont-release-a-patch">recent example</a>). This system might:</p>
<ul>
<li>offer an API on the router that devices call to register their EOL date</li>
<li>inform users when a device approaches EOL</li>
<li>show a dashboard of devices and how long they&rsquo;re supported</li>
<li>automatically contain devices that reach EOL</li>
</ul>
<p>Come to think of it, there&rsquo;s nothing that would technically restrict this to IoT devices. PCs could opt into this too. Probably most useful as a form of parental management of children&rsquo;s devices &ndash; baby&rsquo;s first mdm.</p>
<p>Router manufacturers would have to step up their own game, but they also would get upside: more customer touchpoints.</p>
<p>The best version of this would be an open standard, preserving consumer choice and competition. The hope would be that it improves baseline, even if industry consensus is hard. In the worst case, the consumer isn&rsquo;t served because the standard is captured by the industry, which could then mislead in product ads and/or abuse the customer communications channels with ads.</p>

			 <p>Ironic to use social sanctions (&ldquo;climate incinerating&rdquo;, etc) against cryptocurrency people. The whole point of proof-of-* systems is that social sanctions don&rsquo;t work. An attack that the targets are inoculated against by definition.</p>

			 <p>Regarding AI prose suggestions like <a href="https://twitter.com/benparr/status/1635684322261729282">this</a>, it seems to me that there&rsquo;s a big divide between documents intended for others and notes intended for personal use. Clearly you wouldn&rsquo;t want short sentences like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on it&rdquo; to translate to 2 paragraphs in <a href="https://inkdrop.app">inkdrop.app</a> (my notes app of choice) or <a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian.md</a>.</p>
<p>One place I have noticed this myself is in Github Copilot - so far, its code suggestions have been more helpful than its comment suggestions. In my limited experience, I get idiomatic, non-flowery code that could have been written by anyone, but I get comments that sound off to me. Sometimes the tone strikes me as actively obnoxious; I think this is just that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like I wrote it or could identify with it. I rarely use Copilot&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>Worse, I find them distracting. I don&rsquo;t find its code completion nearly as distracting as how it tries to finish my English sentences in comments. Prior to the latest AI feature rollout from Google, there were ubiquitous short phrase suggestions in Docs and Gmail, which I also found distracting in a similar way. They derail my train of thought, and I end up losing time rather than saving it.</p>
<hr>
<p>&hellip; although I&rsquo;ve also been thinking of ways such verbose automatic rewrites might be helpful.</p>
<p>One hypothetical: if everyone uses ML suggestions, and everyone knows that everyone is using ML suggestions, then you could imagine spending a lot less time analyzing the tone of professional communication for personal slights. For all but the most overt slights, there&rsquo;s plausible deniability in &ldquo;oh well, that was just the AI&rdquo;. This might make fractious professional relationships less uncomfortable, or prevent them from arising in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p>The fact that the appropriateness of a given suggestion is partly determined by its audience prompts the idea that the machine could have many audiences in mind and the user could choose between them. It might have generic heuristics about professional communication or notes to self, or specific training about the way the CEO likes to hear about production problems.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that idea, of choosing an audience for suggestions, prompts an idea that the AI text generation could happen at the time of reading, rather than the time of writing. I wonder if there will ever be a need for a low level conceptual representation that the AI could translate for any type of target audience, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">IR</a> for natural language.</p>
<p>Maybe this starts off by converting the user&rsquo;s natural language input to something that looks like an English prompt. &ldquo;Hello, I hope this email finds you well.&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;greeting, professional, short, top of email, trending on greetingstation, let&rsquo;s greet step by step&rdquo;. Or maybe it&rsquo;s something lower level, some occult binary format that only a dedicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverser</a> could love.</p>
<hr>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotten to the bottom of the post, so I can admit it here: I didn&rsquo;t have any artificial help writing this post. I didn&rsquo;t even reach out to Bing for comment. This way, I get to keep all the mistakes for myself.</p>

			 <p>Fascinating history that feels very relevant today: there was <a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2018/09/fed-nixes-narrow-bank.html">recently a bank startup called TNB</a> that tried to offer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking">&ldquo;narrow banking&rdquo;</a> which would have offered deposit accounts and plops the result directly in the Fed, passing interest to customers (nearly 2% in 2018, although obviously finance people use the obfuscated language of &ldquo;basis points&rdquo; to make everything seem more complicated than it really is). The opposite of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking">fractional-reserve banking</a>.</p>
<p>The Fed did not approve this, and the startup <a href="https://www.tnbusa.com">says</a> it &ldquo;seeks to offer&rdquo; narrow banking to this day &ndash; it cannot accept deposits.</p>
<p>This is relevant to today because <em>runs are impossible</em> in a narrow bank, and FDIC deposit insurance (which has a $250,000 limit) is not necessary. A regular bank takes your money in deposit and immediately loans it out. The bank has a lot of money in absolute terms sitting around liquid so that customers can withdraw approximately whenever they want to, but <em>most</em> money they hold is actually loaned out and therefore illiquid, such that if too many of their customers withdraw at once they will not be able to access it. (This is what happened to SVB.) By contrast, a narrow bank is much simpler; it can always get all of your money immediately from the Fed.</p>
<p>The inimitable Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-09-06/fed-rejects-bank-for-being-too-safe">covered TNB in more approachable language</a>. Basically, if we had that, then why would regular depositors put their money in a regular bank? Maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t. And if customers didn&rsquo;t use regular banks <em>at scale</em>, then maybe your Chase Bank and your Bank of America don&rsquo;t exist any more, and maybe it&rsquo;s hard to figure out of that&rsquo;s bad for society or not.</p>
<p>So the Fed just stonewalled. I have no position on whether this was right or wrong. But it&rsquo;s pretty weird! Runs are impossible in a narrow bank, but also probably business loans of various kinds are more expensive. Maybe that&rsquo;s worse?</p>

			 <p>Imagine browsers offering synced <code>window.localStorage</code>, with an in-browser UI for whether you&rsquo;re logged in to a site. It would be like iCloud for the web - syncing data via your browser sync password, obviating the need to create a new account for every application that wants to store data, as you&rsquo;re already logged in to iCloud.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the user could whitelist sites to allow this; the browser would integrate the whitelist into the log-in UI. This would let the browser keep you logged in forever, fixing the terrible short cookie expiry timelines that browsers enforce now to limit tracking. The in-browser UI would be unspoofable (like eg the Firefox extension installation UI), and it would be impossible to phish the credentials (sort of &ndash; attackers could phish the credentials for the sync service, but not individual websites that use it).</p>
<p>Allowing data to live forever, sync across devices, and be tied to the browser sync profile would mean that apps could rely on static hosting for JavaScript/WebAssembly, and <code>localStorage</code> for user data. Today, lots of apps basically use a server just for hosting user data since browser storage is so unreliable &ndash; those apps could be ported to the web (many automatically with webasm) and live ~forever without requiring hosting costs and security updates. Basically any app designed to run on a desktop operating system and save data to the hard drive could be ported &ndash; MS Paint, Text Edit.app, a full Linux virtual machine with a persistent filesystem via <a href="https://copy.sh/v86/">v86</a>.</p>
<p>Details to work out: Do you allow sharing data between websites? iCloud doesn&rsquo;t, which is annoying, but the implementation is simpler. The best implementations would be end-to-end encrypted. Ideally, you&rsquo;d be able to mix and match storage providers between different browsers, like using Firefox on Windows to sync with Safari on an iPad.</p>
<p>A browser extension could do this, but then sites would have to support it specifically. Might be useful as a proof of concept though. I wonder if there are enough primitives in Safari extensions to implement it today?</p>
